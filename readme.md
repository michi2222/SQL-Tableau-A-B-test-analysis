###  Project Overview
This project analyzes the performance of two campaign variants — **Test** and **Control** — for an e-commerce platform.  
The goal was to evaluate how different campaign strategies impact key performance indicators (KPIs).

###  KPIs Definition
| Metric | Description |
|:--|:--|
| **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** | Percentage of viewers who clicked the ad |
| **PCR (Purchase Conversion Rate)** | Percentage of site visits that ended with a purchase |
| **ATC (Add to Cart)** | Percentage of product viewers who added items to the basket |
| **CPP (Cost Per Purchase)** | Average spend per completed transaction |

---

###  Technologies Used
- **Excel** — data validation and cleaning  
- **SQL** — KPI calculation and aggregation  
- **Tableau** — data visualization and insight presentation  

---

###  Results

| Campaign | CTR | PCR | ATC | CPP |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| **Test** | 11.28% | 8.64% | 47.45% | $4.92 |
| **Control** | 5.99% | 9.83% | 66.88% | $4.53 |

---

###  Insights
- **CTR** increased by **+88%** — the test version drew much more user attention.  
- **PCR** decreased by **–12%** — fewer site visits resulted in purchases.  
- **CPP** increased by **+9%** — the cost per transaction was slightly higher.  
- **ATC** decreased by **–29%** — fewer users added products to cart.  

---

###  Visualization
The results were presented using a **Tableau dashboard** (see attached PDF).  
It compares key metrics across campaigns using clear and accessible visuals.

---

###  Conclusion
The **Test** version successfully improved engagement (CTR) but reduced purchase efficiency (PCR).  
 **Recommendation:** Combine the visual appeal of the Test version with the conversion efficiency of the Control version to maximize overall performance.
